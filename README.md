## Vertical Slice Architecture

This project uses a vertical slice architecture. Each feature (Events, Users, Registrations) is grouped by feature in each layer:

- **Core**: Domain models, interfaces, and domain events for each feature
- **Application**: Commands, queries, handlers, DTOs, and notifications for each feature
- **Infrastructure**: Repositories and configurations for each feature
- **API**: Endpoints, GraphQL types, queries, mutations, and subscriptions for each feature

This structure makes it easy to find all code for a feature and enables true feature-based development.

### Health Checks

- **Endpoint**: `GET /health` - Returns service health status
- **Checks**: PostgreSQL connectivity, AWS Cognito configuration

### Authentication

The API uses JWT tokens from AWS Cognito (mocked via LocalStack in development):

```bash
# Health check (no auth required)
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# With correlation ID for tracing
curl -H "X-Correlation-ID: test-123" http://localhost:5000/health
```
