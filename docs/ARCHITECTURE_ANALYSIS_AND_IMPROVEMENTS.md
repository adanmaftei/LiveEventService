# Architecture Analysis & Improvement TODO

## üìä Executive Summary

**Analysis Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Comprehensive review completed  
**Overall Assessment**: üü¢ **Excellent architectural foundation with high-impact improvement opportunities**

The Live Event Service demonstrates **exemplary architecture** with Clean Architecture, DDD, and modern .NET 9 practices. The system is production-ready with comprehensive testing and observability. This document outlines prioritized improvements for **performance**, **security**, and **resilience** enhancement.

### üéØ **Recent Changes in Code**
- ‚úÖ Registration insert safety and waitlist concurrency: `EventRegistrationRepository` added with navigation state fixes and advisory-lock-based position assignment
- ‚úÖ Database Performance: Indexes migration present (verify actual migration contents if updated separately)
- ‚úÖ Transactional Outbox: `OutboxMessages` table, DbContext writes outbox entries in same transaction; hosted outbox processor enabled in non-testing environments
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Query Optimization: Some `AsNoTracking` usage exists; not all read paths are verified

## üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Architectural Strengths**

- [x] **Clean Architecture**: Proper layer separation with dependency inversion
- [x] **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain models with business logic encapsulation
- [x] **CQRS + MediatR**: Command/query separation with pipeline behaviors
- [x] **Domain Events**: Async processing with real-time GraphQL subscriptions
- [x] **Modern Stack**: .NET 9, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS ECS deployment
- [x] **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and architecture tests
- [x] **DevOps Excellence**: IaC with AWS CDK, CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- [x] **Observability**: Serilog, X-Ray tracing, health checks

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Identified Gaps & Improvement Opportunities**

#### **Performance & Scalability**
- [ ] **No Caching Layer**: All requests hit database directly
- [ ] **Database Performance**: Indexes migration added; confirm exact indexes and coverage
- [ ] **Query Optimization**: Ensure `AsNoTracking()` for all read-only queries
- [ ] **Connection Pooling**: Default settings not optimized for high concurrency

#### **Security**
- [ ] **API Protection**: No rate limiting or request throttling
- [ ] **Input Security**: Missing comprehensive input sanitization
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: No comprehensive audit trail for admin actions
- [ ] **Data Protection**: Sensitive data not encrypted at rest
- [ ] **Security Headers**: Missing security middleware (CSP, HSTS, HTTPS redirection)

#### **Resilience**
- [ ] **Event Reliability**: No outbox pattern - risk of lost domain events
- [ ] **Fault Tolerance**: No circuit breaker pattern for external services
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Limited retry policies and dead letter queues
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Basic health checks but limited business metrics
