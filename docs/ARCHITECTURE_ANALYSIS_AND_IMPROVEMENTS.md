# Architecture Analysis & Improvement TODO

## 📊 Executive Summary

**Analysis Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: Comprehensive review completed  
**Overall Assessment**: 🟢 **Excellent architectural foundation with high-impact improvement opportunities**

The Live Event Service demonstrates **exemplary architecture** with Clean Architecture, DDD, and modern .NET 9 practices. The system is production-ready with comprehensive testing and observability. This document outlines prioritized improvements for **performance**, **security**, and **resilience** enhancement.

### 🎯 **Recent Changes in Code**
- ✅ Registration insert safety and waitlist concurrency: `EventRegistrationRepository` added with navigation state fixes and advisory-lock-based position assignment
- ✅ Database Performance: Indexes migration present (verify actual migration contents if updated separately)
- ✅ Transactional Outbox: `OutboxMessages` table, DbContext writes outbox entries in same transaction; hosted outbox processor enabled in non-testing environments
- ⚠️ Query Optimization: Some `AsNoTracking` usage exists; not all read paths are verified

## 🚀 Prioritized Improvement Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Foundation & Critical Reliability (Completed)**

#### **🟢 Priority A: Quick Wins (Low effort, High impact)**
1) Resilience policies with Polly (retry with jitter, timeout, circuit breaker) for outbound dependencies (AWS SDK, Redis) and Npgsql execution strategy for transient faults.
2) EF performance passes: ensure `AsNoTracking()` on read paths; introduce compiled queries for event list/details and registrations queries.
3) GraphQL DataLoader and depth limits to eliminate N+1 and protect backend. (Completed)
4) OpenTelemetry metrics (ASP.NET Core, EF, HttpClient) + /metrics exposure and basic dashboards/alerts.

#### **🟡 Priority B: Medium effort, High impact**
5) Cache-aside for hot reads (events list/details, registration counts) with invalidation on writes. (Completed baseline)
6) Outbox delivery to SQS with DLQ; worker processes domain events. (Completed)

#### **🔵 Priority C: Medium–High effort**
7) Read replicas (Aurora/RDS) and a replica `DbContext` for read-only queries.
8) WebSocket/GraphQL subscription backplane (Redis) for multi-instance scale.
9) CI/CD hardening: GitHub Actions → ECR/ECS via CDK, Blue/Green, secrets from AWS.
10) Audit logging for admin operations; CSP report endpoint and secret management rollout.
