## Overview

The Live Event Service implements a multi-layered backup and disaster recovery strategy to protect against data loss and ensure business continuity. This includes regular backups, point-in-time recovery, and cross-region replication where applicable.

## Backup Strategy

### Database Backups

#### Automated Backups
- **RDS Automated Backups**:
  - Enabled with a retention period of 35 days
  - Performed daily during the configured backup window
  - Stored in Amazon S3 with encryption at rest using AWS KMS

#### Manual Snapshots
- **Manual DB Snapshots**:
  - Created before major deployments or schema changes
  - Retained for 90 days or as needed
  - Stored in Amazon S3 with encryption at rest

#### Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
- Enabled with a 7-day retention period
- Allows recovery to any second within the retention period
- Useful for accidental data deletion or corruption

### Application Data Backups

#### EBS Volumes
- **EBS Snapshots**:
  - Daily snapshots of EBS volumes
  - Retained for 30 days
  - Stored in the same region with encryption

#### S3 Buckets
- **Versioning**:
  - Enabled on all S3 buckets
  - Preserves all versions of objects
- **Cross-Region Replication**:
  - Critical S3 buckets replicated to a secondary AWS region
  - Provides protection against regional failures

### Configuration Backups
- **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**:
  - All application configuration backed up daily
  - Stored in a dedicated S3 bucket with versioning
- **Infrastructure as Code**:
  - All infrastructure code stored in version control
  - Tagged releases for each deployment

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery

#### Point-in-Time Recovery
```bash
# Restore to a specific point in time
aws rds restore-db-instance-to-point-in-time \
    --source-db-instance-identifier liveevent-db \
    --target-db-instance-identifier liveevent-db-recovery \
    --restore-time "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z" \
    --db-subnet-group-name liveevent-db-subnet-group
```

#### Manual Snapshot Recovery
```bash
# Restore from a manual snapshot
aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot \
    --db-instance-identifier liveevent-db-recovery \
    --db-snapshot-identifier liveevent-db-snapshot-20230101 \
    --db-subnet-group-name liveevent-db-subnet-group
```

### Application Recovery

#### EBS Volume Recovery
1. Create a new volume from the latest snapshot
2. Attach the volume to a new EC2 instance
3. Restore the application and data

#### S3 Object Recovery
```bash
# Restore a previous version of an object
aws s3api get-object \
    --bucket liveevent-bucket \
    --key config/appsettings.json \
    --version-id version-id \
    appsettings.json
```

## Disaster Recovery

### Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

| Component         | RTO (Target) | RPO (Target) |
|-------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Database          | 15 minutes   | 5 minutes    |
| Application Layer | 30 minutes   | 15 minutes   |
| Static Content    | 5 minutes    | 1 minute     |
| Configuration     | 15 minutes   | 1 minute     |

### Multi-Region Deployment
- Primary region: us-east-1 (N. Virginia)
- Secondary region: us-west-2 (Oregon)
- Route 53 DNS failover configured for automatic traffic redirection

### Failover Procedure
1. **Detection**: CloudWatch Alarms trigger on service degradation
2. **Verification**: On-call engineer confirms the incident
3. **DNS Failover**: Update Route 53 to point to secondary region
4. **Data Sync**: Ensure secondary region has latest data
5. **Verification**: Validate service functionality in secondary region
6. **Communication**: Notify stakeholders of the failover

## Testing and Validation

### Backup Testing
- **Weekly**: Restore test database from backup
- **Monthly**: Full disaster recovery drill
- **Quarterly**: Cross-region failover test

### Test Cases
1. **Database Recovery**
   - Restore from point-in-time backup
   - Verify data consistency
   - Validate application connectivity

2. **Application Recovery**
   - Deploy infrastructure in secondary region
   - Restore application from backup
   - Validate functionality

3. **End-to-End Test**
   - Simulate primary region failure
   - Execute failover to secondary region
   - Validate complete service functionality

## Retention Policy

| Backup Type         | Retention Period | Storage Class       |
|---------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| RDS Automated       | 35 days          | Standard            |
| RDS Manual          | 90 days          | Standard            |
| EBS Snapshots       | 30 days          | EBS Snapshot        |
| S3 Object Versions  | 1 year           | S3 Standard-IA      |
| Cross-Region Copies | 90 days          | S3 Standard (DR)    |
| Audit Logs          | 1 year           | S3 + Glacier        |

## Monitoring and Alerts

### CloudWatch Alarms
- Backup completion status
- Backup duration
- Storage capacity
- Failed backup attempts

### SNS Topics
- Backup completion notifications
- Backup failure alerts
- Storage capacity warnings

### AWS Backup Dashboard
- Centralized view of backup status
- Compliance reporting
- Audit trail of backup operations

## Responsibilities

| Role               | Responsibility                          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| DevOps Team        | Implement and maintain backup solutions |
